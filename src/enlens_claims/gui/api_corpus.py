"""0.18.1 part A (documents, theory documents, concepts and team copies): the endpoints of Handler that
part adds, kept out of server.py so the two parts of 0.18.1, built side by side, never edit the same lines.


`Handler` takes this class as a base, so the names in ROUTES resolve on it. server.py adds ROUTES after its own
(the first pattern that matches wins), DOWNLOADS to the routes that may take the token as ?token=, and NOT_A_CHANGE to
the changes after which the shared folder's poller does not bring a round forward."""
